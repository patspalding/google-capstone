# Google Data Analytics Capstone
My Google Data Analytics Capstone project. This was first done in a Jupyter Notebook using the pandas, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries, then redone in R using the tidyverse and skimr libraries.

For this project, I vizualized data from anonymized Fitbit users over a two-month period. I compared weight and activity data for users who log their weights more than 30 times in the time period, and users who logged their weights less frequently. The dataset used in this project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).

The Jupyter Notebook for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/patspalding/google-capstone/blob/main/google-capstone.ipynb), and the R script can be viewed [here](https://github.com/patspalding/google-capstone/blob/main/google-capstone.R).
